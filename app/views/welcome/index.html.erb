      <p>This is a demo Rails App with Rails 5, devise, and a cronjob that deletes
      old ToDos after 7 days. You can create an account and after that start creating 
      ToDos, which you can edit and delete if you're done, otherwise they will 
      automatically get deleted 7 days after their creation.</p>
